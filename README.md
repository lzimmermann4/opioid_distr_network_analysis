## Opioid distributing behavior in Michigan: a network analysis

In this project, we sought to address the following aims: 
(1) examine the structure of the opioid distribution network overall in the State of Michigan, 
(2) investigate important distributors, as well as how perturbing distributor reach may impact concentration of opioid transactions, and
(3) consider community clustering of opioid distribution in the context of Michigan.

To address these objectives, I used a netowrk analysis approach to analyze opiate transaction-level data from the Washington Post Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) public-use database (The Washington Post, 2020). 

Motivation for this research: Opioid overdoses in Michigan increased by a factor of 18 from 1999 to 2018, accounting for 2,599 deahts due to opioids overdoses in 2018 (Michigan.gov, 2022).
